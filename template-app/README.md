# Template Saver - Jira Forge App

This Forge app allows you to save Jira issues as reusable templates. Users can capture issue configurations (summary, description, issue type, priority, components, and labels) and save them for future use.

## Features

- Save any Jira issue as a template directly from the issue panel
- Captures issue metadata including summary, description, type, priority, components, and labels
- Templates are stored using Forge storage and can be reused across projects

See [developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge) for documentation and tutorials explaining Forge.

## Requirements

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

## Quick start

- Modify your app frontend by editing the `src/frontend/index.jsx` file.

- Modify your app backend by editing the `src/resolvers/index.js` file to define resolver functions. See [Forge resolvers](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/custom-ui-resolver/) for documentation on resolver functions.

- Build and deploy your app by running:

```
forge deploy
```

- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running:

```
forge install
```

- Develop your app by running `forge tunnel` to proxy invocations locally:

```
forge tunnel
```

### Notes

- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
